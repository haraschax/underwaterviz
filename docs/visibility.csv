2026-01-31 14:00,25.0,"Closest 4 ft piling is very clear, 11 ft piling visible with some texture, 14 ft piling looks hazy, and the far 30 ft pilings appear only as faint silhouettes; sandy bottom still discernible though muted. That corresponds to faint-visible 30 ft markers → about 25 ft visibility."
2026-01-31 13:00,25.0,"Sandy bottom clearly visible. The farthest ~30 ft pilings can just be made out as hazy silhouettes without clear texture, indicating some loss of clarity compared to reference. Mid and near pilings are clearer but still a bit soft."
2026-01-31 19:00,,"Frame shows only dark static/noise, no discernible underwater scene or pilings, so visibility cannot be determined."
2026-01-31 17:00,15.0,"Closest 4 ft piling is clear, 11 ft piling is visible but soft, 14 ft piling appears only as a hazy silhouette and no distinct view of 30 ft pilings; bottom is faint. This matches the ~15 ft criterion."

2026-01-13 19:00,,Frame shows only dark static/noise with no discernible pilings or seafloor; camera malfunction prevents visibility assessment.
2026-01-11 14:00,15.0,"Closest piling is sharp, the 14 ft piling is visible but lacks clear detail and appears hazy, and the far 30 ft pilings are not discernible. Bottom is visible but background quickly fades, indicating moderate turbidity."
2026-01-11 08:00,25.0,"Closest and mid pilings have some detail, but background is milky. A faint, darker vertical silhouette of the far (~30 ft) piling is still discernible, though without texture, and sandy bottom is barely detectable. Fits the “30 ft piling faintly visible as silhouette” criterion."
2026-01-13 13:00,15.0,Dark object blocks much of view but an encrusted piling at left is still faintly visible without clear texture; farther pilings are barely discernible silhouettes and bottom detail is unclear. Hazy outline around ~14 ft distance suggests moderate turbidity.
2026-01-14 10:00,25.0,"Closest and 11 ft pilings clear; 14 ft piling visible but hazy; faint silhouette of the 30 ft background piling can be made out, indicating moderate clarity but not sharp detail."

2026-01-14 08:00,15.0,"Closest (4 ft) and mid-right (11 ft) pilings are visible but soft; the 14 ft piling is just a faint silhouette with no clear texture, and the far 30 ft pilings are essentially lost in the haze. Bottom detail is not discernible. Conditions match the 14 ft hazy silhouette criterion."
2026-01-15 14:00,15.0,"Closest 4 ft piling is clear, the 11 ft piling is visible but soft, and the 14 ft piling appears only as a hazy silhouette while the sandy bottom is not visible; far 30 ft pilings are not discernible. This corresponds to the 15 ft guideline."

2026-01-16 17:00,15.0,"Image is very dark and grainy; water full of turbidity. Closest piling at right is present but with almost no detail. A second vertical piling silhouette is faintly visible left-of-center, consistent with the 14 ft marker, but it is only a hazy outline and no texture. Farther 30 ft pilings are not discernible. Therefore conditions match the guideline: 14 ft piling hazy silhouette → ~15 ft visibility."
2026-01-17 12:00,25.0,"Sand bottom and all pilings back to ~30 ft are visible. The far 30 ft piling appears only as a hazy silhouette with no discernible texture, indicating some turbidity. Near and mid pilings show detail, but clarity drops noticeably with distance."

2026-01-17 15:00,30.0,"Sandy bottom clearly visible throughout. Farthest ~30 ft pilings can be seen with full shape and some faint detail, though not as crisp as the 35 ft reference; overall scene only lightly hazy."
2026-01-20 06:00,15.0,"Dark, grainy frame. Closest and mid pilings are visible; the 14 ft piling appears only as a faint silhouette, and no texture or sandy bottom is discernible. Farther 30 ft pilings are essentially lost. Hazy outline of the 14 ft piling points to roughly mid-teens visibility."
2026-01-19 11:00,30.0,"Despite a fish partially blocking the middle, the scene behind it remains visible. The near piling is sharp, the farther piling (~30 ft distance) is still clearly discernible with some texture, and the sandy bottom can be seen. This indicates high clarity but slightly less than the exceptional reference."

2026-01-18 07:00,25.0,"Closest and mid-range pilings show clear detail, while the far center-left (~30 ft) piling is only a faint silhouette with almost no texture. Because the 30 ft structure is visible but hazy, visibility is between the 20 ft and 30 ft benchmarks, matching the 25 ft guideline."
2026-01-19 10:00,30.0,"Large crab blocks the right side, but the left half of the image still shows clear water. The instrument-strap piling (~11 ft) is sharp, the next piling (~14 ft) is clearly visible, and a farther slender piling beyond (~30 ft) is still discernible rather than just a faint silhouette. Sandy bottom detail is apparent out to that distance. Overall clarity slightly below the pristine reference but still very good."
