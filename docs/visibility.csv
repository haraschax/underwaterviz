2026-01-01 07:00,25.0,30 ft pilings are present but very hazy silhouettes with little texture; 14 ft pilings also somewhat washed out. Bottom is visible but background loss matches ~25 ft reference.
2026-01-01 09:00,25.0,Closest 4 ft and 11 ft pilings are clear with good texture. The 14 ft piling and the far ~30 ft center pilings are visible but quite hazy; far pilings appear mainly as silhouettes. Sandy bottom is visible but distant background is washed out. This matches the ~25 ft reference where 30 ft pilings are faint silhouettes.
2026-01-01 08:00,15.0,"Closest (4 ft) and 11 ft pilings on right are clear with texture; 14 ft piling on left is visible but somewhat hazy; far 30 ft pilings in center are not discernible as separate structures, just background haze. Sandy bottom is visible around nearer pilings. This matches conditions where the 14 ft piling is a hazy silhouette and 30 ft range is not resolved."
2026-02-01 07:00,25.0,Closest and 11 ft pilings are sharp with good texture; the 14 ft piling is visible but somewhat hazy. The far 30 ft pilings appear only as faint silhouettes. This matches the ~25 ft reference rather than the exceptionally clear 35 ft case.
2026-02-01 09:00,30.0,"The sandy bottom is clearly visible and the far (~30 ft) pilings are present with discernible structure, though slightly hazier than the 35 ft exceptional reference but still more defined than the 25 ft silhouette case. Conditions best match the 30 ft guideline."
2026-02-01 08:00,35.0,"30 ft pilings are clearly visible with discernible texture, and the sandy bottom is clearly visible across the frame, matching the ~35 ft exceptional reference more than the 25–30 ft examples."

2026-01-01 10:00,5.0,"Closest 4ft piling at right is clear with texture. The 11ft piling is not distinctly visible; only a very hazy outline of more distant pilings appears through heavy turbidity, with no clear 14ft or 30ft structures. This matches conditions where only the nearest piling is clearly seen."
2026-01-01 13:00,15.0,"Only very hazy silhouettes of the nearer pilings are visible, with no clear texture and the background quickly fading; this corresponds best to the 14 ft piling being a faint silhouette."
2026-01-01 12:00,15.0,"Water is very green and hazy. The closest 4 ft piling and the 11 ft piling on the right are visible with texture, but the 14 ft piling on the left is only a very faint, low-contrast silhouette and the 30 ft pilings are essentially lost in the haze. This matches the guideline where the 14 ft piling is hazy/faded."
2026-02-01 12:00,35.0,"This frame matches the ~35ft exceptional reference: far (~30 ft) pilings are clearly visible with discernible texture and the sandy bottom is sharp across the scene, indicating maximum categorized clarity."
2026-01-01 11:00,25.0,"Closest 4ft and 11ft pilings are clear with good texture. The 14ft piling in the left mid-ground is visible but somewhat hazy, and the far 30ft piling is only a very faint silhouette. Sandy bottom is visible but distant background is quite muted. This matches conditions slightly better than the 25ft reference but still within that range."
2026-02-01 10:00,25.0,"Closest and 11ft/14ft pilings are clear with good texture. The far ~30ft piling in the center is visible only as a hazy silhouette, similar to the 25ft reference, and the sandy bottom is visible but not sharply defined.

2026-02-01 13:00,30.0,"Closest 4ft and 11ft pilings are sharp with clear texture. The 14ft piling and even the 30ft pilings are visible but increasingly hazy; far pilings appear as soft silhouettes, not crisp. Sandy bottom is visible but with some haze compared to the 35ft reference. This matches conditions slightly better than the 25ft reference but not as clear as 35ft, fitting the 30ft visibility guideline."
2026-01-01 14:00,,"Frame is largely blocked by a close object (likely kelp or similar) and only a uniform water column is visible; pier pilings and distance markers cannot be seen, so a reliable visibility estimate is not possible."
2026-01-01 15:00,5.0,Right-edge closest piling is clear with texture; mid/right and left pilings (~11–14 ft and beyond) are only faint hazy silhouettes. No clear view of 30 ft pilings or bottom. This matches conditions where only the closest piling is truly clear.
2026-01-01 17:00,,"Frame is full of digital noise/static with no discernible pilings, seafloor, or underwater scene, indicating a camera malfunction or invalid snapshot. Visibility cannot be assessed."
2026-02-01 14:00,35.0,"The sandy bottom is clearly visible and the far pilings around 30 ft show distinct shape and some texture, comparable to the ~35 ft exceptional reference rather than the hazier 25–30 ft cases. Thus visibility reaches the far pilings with good clarity."

2026-02-01 15:00,15.0,"Closest 4ft and 11ft pilings on right are sharp with clear texture. The 14ft piling on left is visible but somewhat hazy. Farthest ~30ft pilings are not distinctly visible as silhouettes, blending into the blue background. This corresponds to conditions where the 14ft piling is hazy and distant pilings are lost, around 15 ft visibility."
2026-02-01 16:00,15.0,"Closest and 11 ft pilings on right show clear texture. The 14 ft piling on left is visible but quite hazy, with muted detail compared to the 20 ft reference.

2026-02-01 17:00,15.0,"Image is very murky; mid-distance (≈14 ft) piling is only a hazy silhouette with no clear texture, farther pilings barely distinguishable. This matches ~15 ft guideline for a faded 14 ft piling."
2026-01-02 06:00,,"Frame is completely black with no discernible pilings, seafloor, or water column, likely camera offline or lens fully obscured, so visibility cannot be estimated."
2026-01-02 07:00,20.0,"Sandy bottom clearly visible. The 14 ft piling is fairly sharp with discernible texture, while the more distant (~30 ft) pilings appear as hazy silhouettes lacking detail, not as clear as the 25 ft reference where they are more distinct. This corresponds best to the 20 ft guideline where the 14 ft piling is sharp but farther pilings are obscured."
2026-02-01 19:00,,"Frame is completely obscured by sensor noise/static with no discernible pilings, seafloor, or underwater scene, so a reliable visibility estimate is not possible."
2026-01-02 08:00,30.0,"Closest 4 ft and 11 ft pilings are very sharp with clear texture. The 14 ft piling and farther central piling are visible but somewhat hazy; however, the sandy bottom is clearly visible across the frame. Far piling structure is still reasonably defined, closer to the 35 ft clear-bottom reference than the 25 ft silhouette case. This suggests visibility around 30 ft."
2026-01-02 09:00,30.0,"Image is a clear underwater view. Sandy bottom is visible across the frame. The far (30 ft) pilings are visible with noticeable texture, though slightly hazier than the 35 ft exceptional reference. This corresponds best to ~30 ft visibility per guidelines."
2026-02-02 08:00,25.0,"Closest 4 ft and 11 ft pilings on right are sharp with clear texture. The 14 ft piling on left is visible but somewhat hazy, and the 30 ft pilings in the back are present only as faint silhouettes, similar to the 25 ft reference.

2026-02-02 06:00,5.0,"Image is very dark and grainy, likely low light. Closest 4 ft piling on right is clear with texture; the 11 ft piling is a very hazy silhouette and farther pilings are barely distinguishable. Bottom is only faintly visible. This corresponds to visibility slightly beyond the 4 ft piling but not cleanly out to 11 ft."
2026-02-02 07:00,25.0,"Closest and 11 ft pilings on right are clear with good texture; 14 ft piling on left is also fairly sharp. The far 30 ft pilings are visible only as faint silhouettes, similar to the ~25 ft reference. Sandy bottom is visible but background is hazy, not as crisp as 35 ft day."

2026-01-02 12:00,20.0,Closest and 11 ft pilings are sharp with good texture; 14 ft piling is visible but somewhat hazy; 30 ft pilings are only faint silhouettes. Sandy bottom clearly visible. Conditions between 20 ft (sharp 14 ft piling) and 25 ft (faint 30 ft silhouettes); overall clarity closer to 20 ft due to haze at distance.
2026-01-02 11:00,30.0,"The diagonal dark object in front of the lens does not obscure the scene enough to prevent a reading. The far (~30 ft) pilings are visible with some texture, and the sandy bottom is clearly seen, though slightly hazier than the 35 ft reference. This fits the ~30 ft guideline where 30 ft pilings are mostly visible but less sharp than the exceptional reference."
2026-02-02 09:00,35.0,"Closest 4 ft and 11 ft pilings are very sharp. The 14 ft and ~30 ft pilings are both clearly visible with discernible texture, and the sandy bottom is visible across the scene, similar to the 35 ft reference rather than the hazier 25–30 ft cases."
2026-02-02 15:00,15.0,Closest 4ft piling at right edge is very clear with strong texture. The mid-right ~11ft piling is fully visible but somewhat hazy; the back-left ~14ft piling on the left side appears only as a faint silhouette with little detail. No clear 30ft pilings are visible. This corresponds to conditions where the 14ft piling is a hazy silhouette.
2026-02-02 10:00,30.0,"Sandy bottom is clearly visible and detailed across the frame. The far (~30 ft) pilings are visible with distinct edges and noticeable texture, though slightly hazier than the 35 ft exceptional reference.

2026-02-02 16:00,25.0,"Closest 4 ft and 11 ft/right pilings are sharp with clear texture. The 14 ft piling on the left is visible but somewhat hazy, with reduced contrast, and the 30 ft pilings are only very faint silhouettes in the background. This matches the ~25 ft reference where distant pilings are barely silhouettes but still detectable."
2026-01-02 13:00,30.0,"Closest and 11ft pilings are very sharp with clear encrusting texture. The 14ft piling is also visible with discernible texture. The central ~30ft piling appears as a broad, hazy silhouette without clear detail, but it is definitely visible. Sandy bottom is visible but not as crisp as the 35ft reference. This matches conditions slightly better than the 25ft silhouette-only case, so estimated visibility is around 30 ft."
2026-01-02 14:00,30.0,The sandy bottom is clearly visible and the nearer pilings show good texture. The farthest (~30 ft) pilings are visible but somewhat hazy and lack sharp detail compared to the 35 ft reference. This fits best with the 30 ft visibility guideline.

2026-02-03 08:00,15.0,"Closest 4ft and 11ft pilings on right are clear with texture. The 14ft piling on left is visible but very hazy with little detail, and the far 30ft pilings are essentially lost in the green haze. This matches the guideline where the 14ft piling is a faded silhouette."
2026-01-03 08:00,5.0,Closest 4ft piling at right edge is clear with good texture. The 11ft piling is barely discernible as a hazy column and farther pilings are essentially lost in the green murk; bottom not visible. That indicates water clarity limited to just beyond the nearest piling.
2026-02-03 09:00,15.0,"Closest 4 ft and 11 ft pilings are sharp with clear texture. The 14 ft piling on the left is visible but somewhat hazy; farther 30 ft pilings are only barely suggested as broad shadows with no distinct outline.

2026-01-03 10:00,15.0,"Image is an underwater view but heavily obscured by a thick cable/rope across the frame. However, multiple pier pilings are still visible as faint silhouettes: the closer right piling is somewhat discernible with shape but little texture, and further pilings in the background are very hazy. The 14 ft piling appears only as a blurred silhouette and anything beyond is extremely indistinct, indicating moderate turbidity. This corresponds best to the 15 ft guideline where the 14 ft piling is hazy/faded."
